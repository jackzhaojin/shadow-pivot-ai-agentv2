### 3.11 Step 10: Automated Code Testing and Quality Validation
**Complexity**: Very High | **Effort**: Very High
**Story**: As a developer receiving generated code, I can trust that all code implementations have been automatically tested for functionality, quality, accessibility, and structure so that I receive production-ready code that meets quality standards.

**ðŸ“š Pre-Read Requirements:**

- [ ] Verify performance: optimized rendering and bundle size
- [ ] Validate structure: proper component organization
- [ ] Generate quality scores for each implementation

### 3.12 Step 11: Aggregate Scoring and Best Code Selection
**Complexity**: High | **Effort**: Medium
**Story**: As a user in the code generation pipeline, I can see the agent automatically select the best code implementation using aggregate scoring that combines multiple evaluation metrics so that I receive the optimal implementation without manual review.

- [ ] **Review previous scoring patterns**: Study existing aggregate scoring logic from design evaluation and spec selection steps
- [ ] Implement weighted evaluation combining all testing criteria
- [ ] Automatically select highest-scoring implementation
- [ ] Provide detailed scoring breakdown in execution trace
- [ ] Display selection reasoning in the UI
- [ ] Store selected code in client-side state

### 3.13 Step 12: Complete Artifact Download Package
**Complexity**: High | **Effort**: High
**Story**: As a user completing the AI agent pipeline, I can download a complete ZIP archive containing the selected Figma specs, generated code, and full execution trace so that I have all deliverables and can understand the agent's decision-making process.

**ðŸ“š Pre-Read Requirements:**
- [Step 3.5 Implementation Analysis](./docs/technical/blueprint/step-3.5-implementation-analysis.md) - Study parallel processing patterns, error handling, and architectural decisions
- [Core Capabilities Blueprint](./docs/technical/blueprint/core-capabilities.md) - Review agent step timeline architecture and development guidelines

- [ ] **Review previous artifact handling patterns**: Study existing download utilities and Azure blob storage integration patterns
- [ ] Create ZIP archive with selected Figma specs and code
- [ ] Include detailed execution trace with all agent decisions
- [ ] Provide download functionality from the UI
- [ ] Store artifacts in user-specific blob storage path (`userId/executionId/`)
- [ ] API route: `/api/agent/store-execution` for blob storage integration

## Phase 4: Execution Management & History (release 1.1 Prep)
**Status**: FUTURE | **Target**: Advanced user management and execution tracking

### 4.1 Execution History and User-Scoped Storage
**Complexity**: High | **Effort**: High
**Story**: As a user with multiple AI agent runs, I can access my execution history and download artifacts from past runs so that I can retrieve previous work and track my project iterations.

**ðŸ“š Pre-Read Requirements:**
- [Step 3.5 Implementation Analysis](./docs/technical/blueprint/step-3.5-implementation-analysis.md) - Study parallel processing patterns, error handling, and architectural decisions
- [Core Capabilities Blueprint](./docs/technical/blueprint/core-capabilities.md) - Review agent step timeline architecture and development guidelines

- [ ] **Review previous storage patterns**: Study existing user GUID implementation and blob storage organization patterns
- [ ] Store all executions under user-specific blob storage paths (`userId/executionId/`)
- [ ] API route: `/api/agent/get-execution-history` - List execution IDs for the user
- [ ] API route: `/api/agent/get-execution-details` - Retrieve specific execution artifacts
- [ ] Provide UI to browse execution history
- [ ] Enable download of artifacts from past executions
- [ ] Maintain execution metadata and trace logs

## Phase 5: Advanced Error Handling & Polish (release 1.1 Prep)
**Status**: FUTURE | **Target**: Production-grade reliability and user experience

### 5.1 Error Handling and User Feedback
**Complexity**: Medium | **Effort**: High
**Story**: As a user when the AI agent encounters errors, I can see clear error messages and understand what went wrong in the pipeline so that I can take appropriate action or retry with different inputs.

**ðŸ“š Pre-Read Requirements:**
- [Step 3.5 Implementation Analysis](./docs/technical/blueprint/step-3.5-implementation-analysis.md) - Study parallel processing patterns, error handling, and architectural decisions
