- Refactor React state so manual triggering is no longer required.
- Address defects uncovered during MVP development.
- Improve code organization without adding major new features.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Cypress UI Testing** – Set up and run end-to-end tests for the agent flow.
2. **React State Refactoring** – Resolve the bug that requires manual state triggers.
3. **General Bug Fixes** – Address miscellaneous stability issues across the app.
