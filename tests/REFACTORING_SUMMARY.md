# Test Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Test Type Categorization
We've implemented a clear separation of test types based on their dependencies and purpose:
- **Unit Tests**: Pure business logic tests with no external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that integrate with external services like Azure
- **API Tests**: Tests for API routes and service layers
- **UI Tests**: Tests for UI components with NextJS dependencies
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests for complete user journeys

### 2. Directory Structure
Created a unified test structure under the `/tests` directory:
```
/tests
  /unit          - Pure business logic tests
  /integration   - DAO and service layer tests
  /api           - API route tests
  /ui            - UI component tests
  /e2e           - End-to-end user journey tests
  /fixtures      - Shared test data and helpers
```

### 3. Test Data Management
- Implemented a centralized test fixture system in `/tests/fixtures/testFixtures.js`
- Created mock data for user information, Azure services, and AI responses
- Added helper functions for generating test data dynamically

### 4. Test Runners
- Created a master test runner for running all tests
- Implemented category-specific runners for focused testing
- Made runners robust to handle both existing and future test files

### 5. Package.json Scripts
Added new test scripts for different test categories:
- `npm run test`: Run all tests
- `npm run test:unit`: Run unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration`: Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:api`: Run API tests only
- `npm run test:ui`: Run UI tests only
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run E2E tests only
- `npm run test:legacy`: Run legacy test scripts

### 6. Documentation
- Created detailed README.md with test architecture guidelines
- Documented test naming conventions and organization
- Added guidelines for writing new tests

## Migration Progress
- ✅ User GUID tests migrated to unit tests
- ✅ AI Connection tests migrated to integration tests
- ❌ Other tests pending migration

## Next Steps
1. Continue migrating existing tests to the appropriate categories
2. Update CI/CD pipeline to use the new test structure
3. Create test templates for each category to streamline new test creation

## Benefits of the New Structure
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Tests are organized by their dependencies and purpose
2. **Efficient Test Runs**: Can run specific test categories as needed
3. **Better Test Data Management**: Centralized fixtures reduce duplication
4. **Improved Documentation**: Clear guidelines for writing and running tests
5. **Scalability**: Structure can accommodate growth of test suite
