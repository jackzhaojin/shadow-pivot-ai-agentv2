## Reference Resources

### GitHub Repositories to Reference
- **Workflow**: [main_shadow-pivot-nextjsv2.yml](https://github.com/jackzhaojin/shadow-pivot-nextjs/blob/main/.github/workflows/main_shadow-pivot-nextjsv2.yml)
- **Dockerfile**: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jackzhaojin/shadow-pivot-nextjs/blob/main/Dockerfile)
- **Docker Ignore**: [.dockerignore](https://github.com/jackzhaojin/shadow-pivot-nextjs/blob/main/.dockerignore)

### Key Commands for Testing
```bash
# Local Docker testing
docker build -t shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2 .
docker run -p 3000:3000 shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2

# Azure CLI (if needed)
az login
az webapp list
az webapp restart --name <app-name> --resource-group <rg-name>
```

## Blockers & Risks

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Docker build failures due to Next.js 15.1.8 differences
- [ ] Azure Storage Account access permissions issues
- [ ] Azure AI Foundry model availability or quotas
- [ ] DefaultAzureCredential authentication problems
- [ ] GitHub Actions authentication issues with Azure
- [ ] Azure App Service container deployment problems
- [ ] Managed Identity permission configuration
- [ ] Port configuration mismatches

### Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Test Docker builds locally before pushing
- [ ] Test Azure connections with `az login` before managed identity
- [ ] Have Azure CLI ready for debugging permissions
- [ ] Keep reference repos accessible for comparison
- [ ] Document all Azure configuration steps
- [ ] Test Azure SDK calls in isolation before integration

## Daily Progress Log

### Work Session Log
- **Session 1 (Completed)**: Docker containerization
  - ‚úÖ Created Dockerfile and .dockerignore  
  - ‚úÖ Tested local builds and container execution
  - ‚úÖ Verified Next.js app runs perfectly in container
  - **Time spent**: ~1-2 hours
  - **Status**: Ready for next phase

### When Time Allows - Next Sessions
- **Option A**: GitHub Actions setup (~1-2 hours)
- **Option B**: Azure infrastructure setup (~2-3 hours)  
- **Option C**: Basic Azure integration testing (~1-2 hours)

*No pressure, no deadlines - just progress when life allows!*

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions for Deployment
- Using Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Azure App Service for hosting (familiar, proven)
- Container Registry via GitHub or Azure (TBD based on workflow)

### Immediate Scope Constraints
- **No feature development** until deployment works
- **No infrastructure automation** (manual Azure setup for now)
- **No advanced configurations** (SSL, custom domains later)
- **Focus on baseline functionality** only

### Success Definition
‚úÖ **Deployment Success** = Pushing code to GitHub triggers automatic build and deployment to Azure, resulting in accessible web app

This is the ONLY success criteria for Phase 1. Everything else is secondary.
