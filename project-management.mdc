  - [x] Basic client-side state management for the agent flow (e.g., React Context or Zustand/Jotai).

- **3.1.2 User Identity Management (Client-Side GUID)**
  - [x] **Define integration/functional tests for user GUID management** (e.g., test GUID generation, persistence, display, and API usage)
  - [x] Implement logic to generate a unique GUID on the client-side for the user (if one doesn't exist in local storage).
  - [x] Store the User GUID in local storage to persist across sessions.
  - [x] Display the User GUID in the UI (e.g., in a settings or profile area).
  - [x] Ensure User GUID is available to be sent with API requests for backend processing (e.g., blob storage paths).
  - [x] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.1.3 Execution Tracking & Display (Client-Side MVP)**
  - [x] **Define integration/functional tests for execution tracking and timeline UI** (e.g., test execution ID tracking, timeline rendering, event logging)
  - [x] Implement basic client-side state to track current execution ID (can be a timestamp or simple counter per session initially).
  - [x] Implement a collapsible timeline UI component.
    - Display start/end timestamps for major agent stages (e.g., Design, Figma, Code).
    - Log key events or decisions in the timeline.

  - [x] API route: `/api/agent/generate-design-concepts`
    - Input: Creative brief, User GUID.
  - [x] Backend: Use `aiClient.ts` to call LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to generate 1-3 design concepts (text/JSON).
  - [x] Store generated concepts in client-side state.
  - [x] Display concepts in the sequential UI.
  - [x] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**
  - [x] **VALIDATION COMPLETE: API endpoint tested via curl and returns detailed design concepts. AI Foundry integration working correctly with proper deployment name usage.**

- **3.2.3 Step 2: Design Evaluation (LLM)**
  - [ ] **Define integration/functional tests for design evaluation** (e.g., test scoring/ranking, state update, UI display)
  - [ ] API route: `/api/agent/evaluate-designs`
    - Input: Generated design concepts, User GUID.
  - [ ] Backend: Use `aiClient.ts` to call LLM to score and rank concepts.
  - [ ] Store evaluation results in client-side state.

  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.2.4 Step 3: Figma Spec Generation (LLM - Simplified MVP)**
  - [ ] **Define integration/functional tests for Figma spec generation** (e.g., test API input/output, state update, UI display)
  - [ ] API route: `/api/agent/generate-figma-spec`
    - Input: Selected design concept, User GUID.
  - [ ] Backend: Use `aiClient.ts` to call LLM to generate a simplified Figma-compatible spec (JSON).
    *(Focus on structure, not pixel-perfect visual fidelity for MVP)*
  - [ ] Store generated spec in client-side state.
  - [ ] Display confirmation or a simple view of the spec structure in UI.
  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.2.5 Step 4: Spec Selection (LLM or User Choice for MVP)**
  - [ ] **Define integration/functional tests for spec selection** (e.g., test selection logic, state update, UI confirmation)
  - [ ] If multiple specs were generated (unlikely for MVP's simplified Figma step), allow user to select or have LLM select.
  - [ ] For MVP with single spec: Display the generated spec for user confirmation.
  - [ ] Store selected/confirmed spec in client-side state.
  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.2.6 Step 5: Code Generation (LLM - Simplified MVP)**

  - [ ] Display a snippet or confirmation of the generated code in UI.
  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.2.7 Step 6: Code Selection & Testing (LLM Review - Simplified MVP)**
  - [ ] **Define integration/functional tests for code selection and review** (e.g., test review logic, state update, UI confirmation)
  - [ ] If multiple code versions (unlikely for MVP), allow user or LLM to select.
  - [ ] For MVP with single code output: Use LLM for a very basic review (e.g., "does this code seem to match the spec? any obvious errors?"). This is a lightweight check, not full testing.
  - [ ] Store selected/reviewed code in client-side state.
  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **3.2.8 Step 7: Blob Storage Integration & Final Download**
  - [ ] **Define integration/functional tests for blob storage and artifact download** (e.g., test storage API, ZIP packaging, download, retrieval)
  - [ ] API route: `/api/agent/store-execution`
    - Input: All artifacts (brief, concepts, spec, code), execution trace, User GUID, Execution ID.
  - [ ] Backend:
    - Generate a unique `executionId` if not provided by client (e.g., UUID).
    - Use `lib/storageClient.ts` to save all artifacts to Azure Blob Storage under `[UserGUID]/[executionId]/`.
      - `creative_brief.txt`
      - `design_concepts.json`
      - `figma_spec.json`
      - `generated_code.tsx` (or a zip of multiple files if structure is complex)
      - `execution_trace.json`
  - [ ] Implement actual ZIP packaging for the "Download Artifacts" button:
    - Fetch artifacts from client-side state (or directly from blob if preferred, though client-state is simpler for MVP).
    - Create a ZIP file containing all items from the current execution.
  - [ ] API route: `/api/agent/get-execution-history` (Basic for now)
    - Input: User GUID
    - Backend: List execution IDs for the user from Blob Storage (listing folders).
  - [ ] API route: `/api/agent/get-execution-details` (Basic for now)
    - Input: User GUID, Execution ID
    - Backend: Retrieve all files for a specific execution from Blob Storage.
  - [ ] **Validate by running the defined tests and confirming all pass**

- **Option B**: Azure infrastructure setup (~2-3 hours)  
- **Option C**: Basic Azure integration testing (~1-2 hours)

*No pressure, no deadlines - just progress when life allows!*

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions for Deployment
- Using Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Azure App Service for hosting (familiar, proven)
- Container Registry via GitHub or Azure (TBD based on workflow)

### Immediate Scope Constraints
- **No feature development** until deployment works
- **No infrastructure automation** (manual Azure setup for now)
- **No advanced configurations** (SSL, custom domains later)
- **Focus on baseline functionality** only

### Success Definition
✅ **Deployment Success** = Pushing code to GitHub triggers automatic build and deployment to Azure, resulting in accessible web app

This is the ONLY success criteria for Phase 1. Everything else is secondary.
