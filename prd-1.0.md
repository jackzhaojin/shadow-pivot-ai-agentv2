# Product Requirements Document - Release 1.0 (MVP)

The 1.0 release delivers a minimal design-to-Figma workflow. The goal is to prove out the basic agent pipeline without generating code or using Azure Blob Storage.

## Goals
- Allow users to submit a short creative brief.
- Generate multiple design concepts and select the best one.
- Produce a Figma specification of the chosen design.
- Provide a single download of the selected Figma spec (ZIP).
- Show progress through a visual step timeline with basic error handling.

## Scope
- **Design Concept Generation** → **Evaluation** → **Figma Spec Generation** → **Spec Selection** → **Download**.
- No code generation.
- No Azure Blob Storage integration.
- React client displays progress states (waiting, processing, completed, error).
- Manual abort button to cancel an in‑flight run.

## Out of Scope
- Storing executions across sessions.
- Any code generation or preview features.
- Advanced error recovery or retry flows.
- Integration with external services beyond Azure AI for design generation.
