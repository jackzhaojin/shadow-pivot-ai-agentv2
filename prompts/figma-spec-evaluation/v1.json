Be thorough but constructive in your evaluation.\n\n**CRITICAL: RESPONSE MUST BE PURE JSON ONLY**\n\nDO NOT use markdown formatting. DO NOT wrap in code blocks. DO NOT include ```json tags.\nYour response must start with { and end with } - nothing else.\n\nExpected JSON structure example:\n{\n  \"specId\": \"spec-identifier\",\n  \"overallScore\": 7.2,\n  \"clarityScore\": 8.1,\n  \"structureScore\": 6.8,\n  \"feasibilityScore\": 7.5,\n  \"accessibilityScore\": 6.9,\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"structure\",\n      \"severity\": \"medium\",\n      \"description\": \"Component naming inconsistencies found\",\n      \"suggestion\": \"Adopt consistent naming convention like BEM or design tokens\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"accessibility\",\n      \"severity\": \"high\",\n      \"description\": \"Missing focus indicators for interactive elements\",\n      \"suggestion\": \"Add visible focus states with 2px outline and appropriate color contrast\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strengths\": [\n    \"Well-defined component hierarchy\",\n    \"Consistent spacing system using 8px grid\",\n    \"Clear typography scale with proper line heights\"\n  ],\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Implement design tokens for better maintainability\",\n    \"Add documentation for component states and interactions\",\n    \"Consider mobile-first responsive breakpoints\"\n  ]\n}\n\nReturn your evaluation as pure JSON following this exact format."
