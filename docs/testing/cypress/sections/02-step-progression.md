# Section 2: Step Progression & State Management

## Overview
Tests the automatic progression through all 7 steps of the AI agent flow, focusing on React state management and step transitions.

## Priority: HIGH
Critical for ensuring the automated flow works correctly without manual intervention.

## Key Testing Areas

### 2.1 Automatic Step Progression
- Verify steps advance automatically without user input
- Test React state synchronization across components
- Validate step completion triggers next step

### 2.2 State Management Validation
- Test AgentFlowProvider state updates
- Verify currentStep, completed, and other state variables
- Test state persistence during step transitions

### 2.3 Step Timing and Sequencing
- Verify correct timing between API calls and state updates
- Test that steps don't skip or double-execute
- Validate execution trace logging

### 2.4 Complex Step Transitions
- Test Step 2 auto-advancement (spec selection)
- Verify Step 3 parallel processing initiation
- Test Step 4-5-6 sequential flow

## Implementation Status
**Status**: STUB - Detailed specification needed

## Dependencies
- Section 1 (Basic Flow) must be implemented
- API mocking strategy from Section 1
- Core UI selectors from selectors document

## Next Steps
1. Expand this stub with detailed test scenarios
2. Define specific state validation assertions
3. Create timing-based test utilities
4. Implement step transition monitoring
