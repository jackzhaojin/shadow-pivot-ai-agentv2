# Section 8: Performance & Load Testing

## Overview
Tests application performance under various load conditions and measures response times.

## Priority: LOW
Optimization and performance validation for production readiness.

## Key Testing Areas

### 8.1 Step Execution Performance
- Measure step completion times
- Test under different system loads
- Validate memory usage patterns
- Monitor CPU utilization

### 8.2 API Response Time Testing
- Measure API endpoint response times
- Test with simulated network delays
- Validate timeout handling
- Monitor concurrent request performance

### 8.3 UI Responsiveness Testing
- Test UI interactions under load
- Measure component render times
- Validate smooth animations
- Test large dataset handling

### 8.4 Resource Usage Monitoring
- Monitor network request sizes
- Validate bundle size impact
- Test memory leak detection
- Monitor browser resource usage

## Implementation Status
**Status**: STUB - Detailed specification needed

## Dependencies
- All functional tests stable
- Performance monitoring tools
- Load testing infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Set up performance monitoring tools
2. Define performance benchmarks
3. Create load testing scenarios
4. Implement performance regression detection
