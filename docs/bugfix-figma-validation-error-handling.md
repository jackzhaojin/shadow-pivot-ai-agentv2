# Bug Fix Summary: Figma Spec Validation Error Handling

**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Agent flow stopping when one figma generator failed instead of continuing with valid specs  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem Description

The AI agent flow was designed to generate 3 figma specs in parallel, then evaluate them and continue to selection. However, when one of the 3 generators produced an invalid spec (missing the required `name` field), the entire flow would stop with an error instead of gracefully continuing with the 2 valid specs.

### Error Details
- **Error Message**: "Invalid spec at index 2: missing or invalid name field"
- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **Expected Behavior**: Continue with 2 valid specs
- **Actual Behavior**: Flow stopped completely

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **API Validation Too Strict**: The `/api/agent/evaluate-figma-specs` endpoint was doing strict validation and immediately returning a 400 error if ANY spec was invalid
2. **No Graceful Degradation**: The system was designed as all-or-nothing instead of filtering invalid items
3. **Frontend Had Fallbacks But Couldn't Use Them**: The StepExecutor had fallback logic, but the 400 status prevented it from running

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Changes (`app/api/agent/evaluate-figma-specs/route.ts`)
- **Before**: Strict validation - reject entire request if any spec invalid
- **After**: Filter validation - separate valid and invalid specs
- Continue processing if at least 1 valid spec exists
- Return warning information about any filtered specs
- Only fail if ALL specs are invalid

### 2. Frontend Improvements (`features/ai/components/flow/StepExecutor.tsx`)
- Enhanced logging to show filtered spec details
- Added warnings when specs are filtered out
- Display original vs processed spec counts
- Better error messaging for debugging

### 3. Validation Robustness (`lib/utils/promptUtils.ts`)
- Enhanced prompt template validation to properly check required fields
- Added support for `required` array in JSON schema validation
- Validation for empty string fields and nested property types
- Better type checking for arrays and objects

## Testing

Created comprehensive test (`tests/endpoints/test-figma-evaluation-invalid-specs.js`) that:
- Sends 5 specs: 2 valid, 3 invalid (missing name, null name, empty name)
- Verifies API returns 200 status with exactly 2 evaluation results
- Confirms warning message about filtered specs is included
- Validates detailed information about why each spec was invalid

### Test Results
```
✅ Test Passed!
- Input: 5 specs (2 valid, 3 invalid)
- Output: 2 evaluation results + warning about 3 filtered specs
- Status: 200 OK (no longer 400 error)
- Flow: Can now continue to spec selection with 2 valid specs
```

## Verification

1. **Standard Test Still Passes**: `npm run test:figma-evaluation` ✅
2. **New Invalid Spec Test Passes**: `node tests/endpoints/test-figma-evaluation-invalid-specs.js` ✅
3. **Agent Flow Continues**: When 1 generator fails, flow proceeds with remaining 2 specs ✅

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/agent/evaluate-figma-specs/route.ts` - API filtering logic
2. `features/ai/components/flow/StepExecutor.tsx` - Frontend warning handling  
3. `lib/utils/promptUtils.ts` - Enhanced validation robustness
4. `tests/endpoints/test-figma-evaluation-invalid-specs.js` - New test for mixed scenarios
5. `release-1.0.mdc` - Documentation update

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Agent flow no longer stops unexpectedly
- **Reliability**: System gracefully handles partial failures
- **Transparency**: Users can see what was filtered and why
- **Maintainability**: Better error handling and logging for debugging

This fix ensures the AI agent pipeline is more robust and provides a better user experience when dealing with AI generation variability.
