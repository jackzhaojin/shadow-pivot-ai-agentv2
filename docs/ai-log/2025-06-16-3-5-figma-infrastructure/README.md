# Task 3.5 - Parallel Figma Spec Generation Infrastructure

## Overview

Initial infrastructure for parallel Figma spec generation has been implemented. When the agent reaches step 4, the UI now displays three concurrent generation boxes with realâ€‘time progress indicators.

## Key Points

- Added `figmaSpecStates` to `AgentFlowProvider` for tracking progress of three parallel processes.
- Created `FigmaGenerationBox` and `FigmaGenerationGrid` components to render progress bars.
- Step executor simulates parallel progress and auto completes the step when all boxes finish.
- Added utility helpers in `lib/utils/figmaGeneration.ts` with accompanying tests.
- Implemented minimal `figmaSpec` service and `/api/agent/generate-figma-specs` endpoint for generating specs.

This lays the groundwork for full spec generation and validation in future tasks.
