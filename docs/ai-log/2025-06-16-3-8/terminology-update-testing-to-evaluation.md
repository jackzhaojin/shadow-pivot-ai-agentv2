# Terminology Update Summary: From "Testing" to "Evaluation"

## Changes Made
Successfully updated all terminology from "testing" to "evaluation" to maintain consistency with the existing "evaluate design" pattern and avoid confusion with unit/integration testing.

## Files Updated

### Core Files Renamed
- `prompts/figma-spec-testing/` → `prompts/figma-spec-evaluation/`
- `lib/services/figmaSpecTesting.ts` → `lib/services/figmaSpecEvaluation.ts`
- `app/api/agent/test-figma-specs/` → `app/api/agent/evaluate-figma-specs/`
- `features/ai/components/flow/FigmaTestingResults.tsx` → `features/ai/components/flow/FigmaEvaluationResults.tsx`

### Interface and Function Names Updated
- `SpecTestingResult` → `SpecEvaluationResult`
- `testFigmaSpec()` → `evaluateFigmaSpec()`
- `testFigmaSpecs()` → `evaluateFigmaSpecs()`
- `FigmaTestingResults` → `FigmaEvaluationResults`
- `figmaTestingResults` → `figmaEvaluationResults`
- `setFigmaTestingResults` → `setFigmaEvaluationResults`

### Step Title Updated
- "Figma Spec Testing & Quality Assurance" → "Figma Spec Evaluation & Quality Assurance"

### Provider Context Updated
- AgentFlowProvider now uses `figmaEvaluationResults` state
- Step executor integration updated with new variable names
- All dependency arrays and useEffect hooks updated

### API Endpoint Updated
- New endpoint: `/api/agent/evaluate-figma-specs`
- Request/response format maintained for compatibility
- Input validation and error handling preserved

## Consistency Achieved
- ✅ Matches existing "evaluate design" pattern
- ✅ Clear distinction from unit/integration testing
- ✅ Maintains professional terminology
- ✅ All variable names and file structures aligned
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ UI components use consistent naming

## Benefits
1. **Clarity**: "Evaluation" clearly indicates quality assessment rather than automated testing
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with existing `evaluate-designs` endpoint and service
3. **Professional**: Uses industry-standard terminology for design quality assessment
4. **Maintainable**: Consistent naming makes code easier to understand and maintain

The implementation now uses consistent "evaluation" terminology throughout while maintaining all the functionality and architectural patterns established in the original implementation.
