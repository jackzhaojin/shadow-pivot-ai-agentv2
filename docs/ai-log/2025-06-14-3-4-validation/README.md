# Task 3.4 - Interactive Step Results Review with Validation Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the AI Agent Flow by adding interactive validation capabilities to completed steps. Users can now:

1. Click on any completed step in the timeline to view detailed input/output
2. Validate or invalidate each step with optional feedback
3. See validation status through visual indicators in the UI

## Implementation Details

### Components Added

- **ValidationPanel**: A new component that allows users to mark a step as valid or invalid and provide feedback
- Added test files to ensure functionality works as expected

### State Management

- Extended `AgentFlowProvider` with:
  - `validatedSteps` and `invalidatedSteps` state
  - `markStepValidated` and `markStepInvalidated` methods
  - Reset validation state when starting a new execution

### UI Enhancements

- Visual indicators in the timeline for validated/invalidated steps
- Color coding for step panels based on validation status
- Interactive buttons for validation actions
- Feedback text area for capturing validation notes

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Added tests for ValidationPanel component
- **Integration Tests**: Added tests for AgentFlowProvider validation state management
- Included in the standard test suite via run-ui-tests.js

## User Flow

1. User initiates the agent flow
2. As steps are completed, they can click on any completed step
3. The step details panel opens showing input/output for that step
4. User can validate (mark as correct) or invalidate (mark as incorrect) the step
5. When invalidating, the user must provide feedback
6. The timeline updates to show validation status with color-coded indicators
