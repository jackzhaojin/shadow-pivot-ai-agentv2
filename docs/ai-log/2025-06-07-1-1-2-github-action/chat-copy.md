jackzhaojin: Great work so far, now let's give 1.2 ago

GitHub Copilot: I can see from your project management document that Docker containerization is complete and you're ready to move on to section 1.2 - GitHub Actions Workflow. Let me help you set up the GitHub Actions workflow by first fetching the reference workflow from your shadow-pivot-nextjs repository. Let me search more specifically for the GitHub Actions workflow file: Let me search more specifically for GitHub Actions workflow files: I don't see the GitHub Actions workflow file in the results. Let me try a direct file search approach: Great! I found the GitHub Actions workflow. Now let me create the `.github/workflows` directory and the workflow file for your project, adapting it for your current setup: 

Made changes.

Perfect! Now let me update your project management document to reflect the completion of this task: 
```

Now let me also update the progress log and next session notes:

Perfect! I've successfully completed section 1.2 - GitHub Actions Workflow. Here's what was accomplished:

## âœ… GitHub Actions Workflow Complete

**Created**: main_shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2.yml

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Automated Docker Build & Push** - Triggers on push to main branch
2. **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** - Uses `ghcr.io/[owner]/shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2:latest`
3. **Docker Layer Caching** - Speeds up subsequent builds by caching npm install and build layers
4. **Azure Integration** - Automatically restarts Azure Web App after image push
5. **Proper Permissions** - Configured for GitHub token and Azure authentication

### Configuration Details:
- **Image Target**: `ghcr.io/[owner]/shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2:latest`
- **Resource Group**: `ShadowPivot` 
- **Web App Name**: `shadow-pivot-ai-agentv2`
- **Caching**: Enabled for faster builds

### Next Steps:
The workflow is ready, but you'll need to configure Azure secrets when you're ready to deploy:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` 
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

The workflow will automatically:
1. Build your Docker image using the existing Dockerfile
2. Push it to GitHub Container Registry
3. Restart your Azure Web App to pull the new image

This gives you a complete CI/CD pipeline from code push to deployment! ðŸš€

Ready for the next phase whenever you want to tackle Azure infrastructure setup.
