jackzhaojin: keeping with release 1.1's mission to do cypress first, let's take a look at this file and we should ideally document our flow first from our code.

Let's create a section under docs/testing/cypress for this, please go through each of the logic in components/flow and go through all the intended logic.

I expect a very detailed markdown (no summarization, detail) on how cypress should test this

GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze the flow components and create a comprehensive Cypress testing specification document. First, let me explore the components/flow directory structure and examine the code to understand the interactive flows. Let me check if there's a flow directory or similar components that contain the interactive flows: Now let me examine the features/ai directory structure to understand the flow components better: Let me also check the providers and other key files to understand the complete flow: Now let me check the release documentation and other key files to fully understand the flow: Now let me create the comprehensive testing documentation directory and specification. First, I'll create the directory structure: Now let me create a comprehensive Cypress testing specification document based on the flow components I've analyzed: 

jackzhaojin: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: Now I'll create a comprehensive Cypress testing specification document based on my analysis of the AI agent flow components: 

jackzhaojin: OK a comprehensive cypress testing spec is too much, how about we break it down by piece meal and do one section at a time? how about now that you analyzed the flow, come up with a overlal plan and section stubbings so later executoins can be successful?

I'm getting AI error response limit is hit

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a comprehensive but modular Cypress testing plan with section stubs that can be executed piece by piece. Based on my analysis of the flow components, I'll break it down into manageable sections.

Now I'll create the UI selectors reference document:

Now I'll create the first section stub:

Now I'll create the test utilities stub:

Finally, let me create stubs for the remaining sections:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive modular Cypress testing plan that breaks down the testing into manageable sections. Here's what I've delivered:

## ðŸ“‹ **Complete Testing Structure Created**

### **Main Documents:**
- **README.md** - Overall testing plan and strategy
- **`ui-selectors.md`** - Comprehensive selector reference 
- **`test-helpers.md`** - Reusable utilities and custom commands

### **8 Modular Testing Sections:**
1. **Basic Flow** (HIGH priority) - Fundamental user journey âœ… **DETAILED**
2. **Step Progression** (HIGH priority) - State management and transitions
3. **Interactive Results** (HIGH priority) - Step details and validation
4. **Parallel Processing** (MEDIUM priority) - 3-box Figma generation
5. **Error Handling** (HIGH priority) - Comprehensive error scenarios  
6. **Download & Completion** (MEDIUM priority) - End-to-end flow completion
7. **Visual Regression** (LOW priority) - UI consistency and responsive design
8. **Performance** (LOW priority) - Load testing and optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Sections 1-3)**
Start with these for core functionality:
- Section 1 has **detailed specifications** ready for implementation
- Sections 2-3 have structured stubs for expansion

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features (Sections 4-6)**  
Build on the foundation with complex interactions

### **Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Sections 7-8)**
Polish and performance optimization

## ðŸ”§ **Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Modular Implementation** - Each section can be tackled independently
2. **Clear Dependencies** - Know what needs to be completed first
3. **Priority-Based** - Focus on high-priority items first
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** - All aspects of the flow are planned
5. **Reusable Utilities** - Common patterns are abstracted into helpers

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

To start implementation:
1. **Begin with Section 1** - It has complete specifications ready
2. **Add required `data-testid` attributes** to components as specified
3. **Set up basic Cypress infrastructure** 
4. **Implement Section 1 tests** to validate the approach
5. **Expand subsequent sections** as needed

This modular approach prevents AI response limits while ensuring comprehensive test coverage. Each section can be developed in focused sessions without overwhelming complexity.
