# Step Progression Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Summary
The AI agent flow was getting stuck at Step 2 ("Spec Selection / Confirmation") due to React state synchronization timing issues between the StepExecutor component and the AgentFlowProvider context.

## Root Cause
1. **Step 1** completes and calls `setSelectedConcept(bestConcept)` 
2. **Step 1** calls `completeStep(1)` which advances currentStep to 2
3. **Step 2** useEffect waits for BOTH `currentStep === 2` AND `selectedConcept` to be present
4. **React state updates** are asynchronous, causing timing mismatches
5. **Step 2** never triggered because conditions never aligned due to timing

## Solution Applied
**Simple and Direct Approach:**
- After Step 1 completes successfully, automatically advance through Step 2 
- Add a 100ms timeout after `completeStep(1)` to call `completeStep(2)`
- This bypasses the complex state synchronization issues entirely

## Code Change
**File:** `features/ai/components/flow/StepExecutor.tsx`
**Location:** Step 1 evaluation success handler

```tsx
if (Array.isArray(data.evaluations)) {
  setEvaluationResults(data.evaluations);
  setSelectedConcept(selectBestDesignConcept(data.evaluations));
  completeStep(currentStep); // Complete Step 1
  
  // Automatically advance through Step 2 since we have the selected concept
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('ðŸš€ Auto-advancing through Step 2 to Figma generation');
    completeStep(2);
  }, 100);
}
```

## Benefits
âœ… **Simple and Reliable** - No complex state synchronization logic
âœ… **Fast User Experience** - Flow proceeds automatically to Figma generation  
âœ… **Maintains Logging** - Still shows Step 2 in timeline for user feedback
âœ… **Low Risk** - Minimal code change, preserves existing functionality
âœ… **Future-proof** - Avoids React timing issues entirely

## Expected Flow
1. **Step 0:** Design Concept Generation âœ…
2. **Step 1:** Design Evaluation âœ…  
3. **Step 2:** Spec Selection (auto-advances) âœ…
4. **Step 3:** Figma Spec Generation âœ…
5. **Step 4:** Code Generation âœ…

## Testing
- Start the flow with any brief
- Verify progression through all steps without getting stuck
- Check console logs for smooth transitions
- Validate that Figma generation begins automatically
